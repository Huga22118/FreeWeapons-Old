# Free Weapons For GTA San Andreas (On Progress)
Welcome to My First Repositories, these are Plugins for GTA San Andreas where you can get weapons by press a button.

but it's WIP, to try this mod you need to clone this repository using GitKraken or Git Bash.

I only add ak47, micro uzi, colt45, shotgun.

I'll add all weapons if it possible.

# Requirements
- Visual Studio 2017, 2019
- Plugin-SDK
- Code::Blocks for Plugin-SDK (if you have Visual Studio 2015/2017/2019 then use vs).
